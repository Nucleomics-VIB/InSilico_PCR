## Summary

The gDNA **Zymo-PromethION-EVEN-BB-SN** reads data from [the mockcommunity](https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity) was used as input to extract either the 'full-length' amplicon corresponding to the PCR **27F-U1492R** <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> or the shorter V3V4 amplicon corresponding to the primer combination **337F-805R** <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.

The extracted reads were submitted to the ONT 16S pipeline to cbe classified and allow direct comparison of the two amplicon options at different levels.

## Results

The first pictures return the classification results at genus level
